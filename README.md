# Outline: A Markdown to HTML Static Site Generator

Inspired by [Jekyll][0] but built with the following in mind:
- [Jade][1] templates
- [Markdown][2] documents
- [node.js][3]
- Generates a table of contents from the headings in the markdown document

# Installation

    $ npm install -g outline-md

# Quick Start
Run the following command in the folder containing your `.md` files.

    $ outline-md

This __deletes__ all existing `.html` files in the folder and compiles the `.md` files into HTML using the default layout. 

# Document Metadata (Front Matter)
Much like `Jekyll` posts, you can attach metadata to your documents using [YAML][4]. Here is a sample document

```md
---
title: This is the title of my document.
layout: base
---
# Introduction
Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et. Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue.

# Body
Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum.

# Conclusion
```

# Layouts
Like `Jekyll`, outline searches for layouts in the `_layouts` directory. If no layout is specified, the default layout is used.

```jade
// sample layout
!!!
html
  head
  body
    #toc!= toc
    #contents!= body
```

The jade template is given the `toc` and `body` variables parsed from the markdown. All other metadata from the document front matter is passed to the layout as well.
